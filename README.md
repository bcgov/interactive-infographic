# Interactive-Infographic

## Who 
The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is a central agency of the Province of B.C. that leads strategy, policy and standards for information technology, IT security and the management of the IM/IT investment portfolio for the Province.

##Why
The OCIO is looking for the development of an online infographic for users to interact with. The purpose is to clearly convey multi-dimensional information in a user-friendly, interactive, digital format.

The [OCIO Strategic FrameWork diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcgov/interactive-infographic/master/wireframe/OCIO_Strategy_Framework.png) is a guide.

##What 
This [wireframe](https://github.com/bcgov/interactive-infographic/blob/master/wireframe/wireframe.png) illustrates how the main screen of the interactive infographic might look, and offers some visual context. 

This [second diagram](https://github.com/bcgov/interactive-infographic/blob/master/wireframe/user-interaction.png) illustrates how a user might interact with the infographic.


##Design: 
Ensure that the “content boxes (see wireframe)” can be resized vertically or horizontally, reordered, new content boxes can be added or existing ones removed, graphics, videos and text can be replaced, and additional “content elements” can added to a “content box” or existing ones removed. 

The working prototype may include user navigation/interactive features, including expanding/collapsing content “accordion”, opening dialog windows for more information, tabs, sliders etc.

For the prototype, dummy graphics, text and videos can be used; however, the dev will be expected to provide guidance on how government staff can best ready the production graphics, videos and text (e.g. format, etc) that will eventually populate the live site.

##Out of scope:
- Selection or development of content (e.g. graphics, images, videos, etc.).


- SEO, authentication, etc is not required.

- Hosting of the site.

##The End Result

We will iteratively work on this project. Here's a few thoughts on the desired features for the end-state:

- Provide the final product in a format that can be run on any computer (localhost) through any modern web-browser.

- Flexibility so that the infographic structure (i.e. content boxes & content elements) can be easily modified.

- Flexibility so that the content (e.g. graphics, text, links) can be easily replaced or modified. 

- Device agnostic and responsive.

- Use of commonly known, open web frameworks.

##Project Status
We are actively seeking development work. Additional issues may be created once the prototype is developed for things we would like augment or change.
